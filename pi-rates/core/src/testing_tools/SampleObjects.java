/**
 * This is a very rough way of creating instances of objects for testing purposes that was created before lots of the
 * groundwork for creating things properly was in place. This needs to stay here unless you want to refactor tests, but
 * it is highly recommended that you dont use this if you can help it and use the banks that are now in place instead
 * since they are simpler to use, cleared and less prone to mistakes made from hardcoding everything.
 *
 * These were only used the first place because there was no other facility for creating objects at the start.
